## Explanation

The first thing we have to notice here is that we can get the minimum number
of seconds by doing the bare minimum to make the sequence increasing.
If we have a number that's less than its predecessor, there's *no reason*
to make that number greater than what comes before it.

With that out of the way, we know how much we should add to each number.
To get the overall minimum number of seconds to make the sequence nondecreasing,
we can take the floors of the log base 2 of each number and add 1.

## Implementation

**Time Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(n)$ for each test case.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using std::cout;
using std::endl;
using std::vector;

int main() {
	int test_num;
	std::cin >> test_num;
	for (int t = 0; t < test_num; t++) {
		int size;
		std::cin >> size;
		vector<int> arr(size);
		for (int &i : arr) { std::cin >> i; }

		vector<int> target{arr[0]};
		vector<int> to_add;
		for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {
			if (target.back() > arr[i]) {
				to_add.push_back(target.back() - arr[i]);
				target.push_back(target.back());
			} else {
				target.push_back(arr[i]);
			}
		}

		int min_time = 0;
		for (int a : to_add) {
			min_time = std::max(min_time, (int)log2(a) + 1);
		}
		cout << min_time << endl;
	}
}
```

<PySection>

```py
from math import log2

for _ in range(int(input())):
	size = int(input())
	arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
	assert len(arr) == size

	target = [arr[0]]
	to_add = []
	for i in range(1, size):
		if target[-1] > arr[i]:
			to_add.append(target[-1] - arr[i])
			target.append(target[-1])
		else:
			target.append(arr[i])

	min_time = 0
	for a in to_add:
		min_time = max(min_time, int(log2(a)) + 1)

	print(min_time)
```
